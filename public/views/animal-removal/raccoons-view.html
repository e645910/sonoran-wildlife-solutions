        <h4>If you hear thumping or scampering noises in your attic or chimney at night, chances are a ringtail cat, a raccoon, or a coati has taken up residence with you.  they are all good climbers and jumpers who will go up trees, walls, and stucco.  ringtail cats and raccoons are nocturnal (up during the night), while coatis are diurnal (up during the day).  all three are omnivorous (eat both animals and plants).</h4>

        <h4>Trapping skunks can be tricky, and may not be something you want to tackle.  if you need trapping work done, please call SONORAN WILDLIFE SOLUTIONS at 520-229-7976.</h4>

SONORAN WILDLIFE SOLUTIONS removes and relocates ringtail cats, raccoons, coatis, and skunks in Northwest Tucson, Oro Valley, Dove Mountain, Catalina, Saddlebrooke, and the surrounding areas.</h4>
