        <p>Packrat and rodent control are a constant necessity in the sonoran desert.  left unchecked, packrats, mice, and other rodents can chew through wires and pvc water pipes leaving extensive damage and expensive repairs.  they can also chew through walls, ceilings, and wood, and build nests wherever they go.  chewing noises and scratching noises in attics and walls should cause you concern</p>

        <p>We have found that some homeowner's insurance policy may not pay for rodent damage to pipes or for the replacement of carpets, walls, and ceilings.  in cases where insurance does not cover rodent damage, rodent control, especially packrat control, may be more important than you realize.</p>
